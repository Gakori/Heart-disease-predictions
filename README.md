## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 Heart disease prediction is a project that mainly focuses on making predictions if an individual has heart disease. We use machine learning algorithmsto detrmine the status of an individual. Different Machine Learning algorithms are used including K-Nearest Neighbors, Suport Vector Classifier, Decision trees and Random forest. The data is a classification dataset. We use the provided the variables to make our conclusions.
 These variables are;
 1) age
 2) sex
 3) chest pain type (4 values)
 4) resting blood pressure
 5) serum cholestoral in mg/dl
 6) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
 7) resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
 8) maximum heart rate achieved
 9) exercise induced angina
 10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 11) the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
 12) number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
 13) thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
 
 The target variable is target where 0 is less chance of heart attack and 1 is high chance of heart attack
